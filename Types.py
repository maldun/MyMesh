    Help class to handle elements of a mesh.
    The Intention is to use this class to add more
    OO programming into the smesh Module.
    smesh is a well designed module, much better
    than geompy. Nevertheless we will use
    This objects to enable better OO and functional
    programming capabilities. But we will try to minimize
    the use of self made tools as good as we can.
